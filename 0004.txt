Long ago in a small, faraway village, there was a place known as the House of 1000 Mirrors. A small, happy little dog learned of this place and decided to visit. When he arrived, he hounced happily up the stairs to the doorway of the house. He looked through the doorway with his ears lifted high and his tail wagging as fast as it could. To his great surprise, he found himself staring at 1000 other happy little dogs with their tails wagging just as fast as his. He smiled a great smile, and was answered with 1000 great smiles just as warm and firendly. As he left the House, he thought to himself, " This is a wonderful place. I will come back and visit it often." In this same village, another little dog, who was not quite as happy as the first one, decided to visit the house. He slowly climbed the stairs and hung his head low as he looked into the door. When he saw the 1000 unfriendly looking dogs staring back at him, he growled at them and was horrified to see 1000 little dogs growling back at him. As he left, he thought to himself, " That is a horrible place, and I will never go back there again." All the faces in the world are mirrors. What kind of reflections do you see in the faces of the people you meet? An old cock and a foxIt is evening. An old cock is sitting in a tree. A fox comes to the tree and looks up at the cock." Hello, Mr Cock, I have good news for you," says the fox. "Oh" says thecock, "What good news for me?" "All the animals are friends now." says the fox. "Fine!" says the cock. "I'm very glad to know that." Then he looks up. "Look! A dog ia coming this way." "What? A dog?" says the fox, "Well....well, I must go now. Goodbye,Mr Cock!" "Wait,Mr Fox, Don't you like dogs?" Don't you like playing with the dog? Dogs are our friends now." "But,...but they may not know the news yet." Then he runs away, "I see, I see," says the cock. He smiles and goes to sleep.
